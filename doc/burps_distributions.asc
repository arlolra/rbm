======================

NAME
----
burps_distributions - burps distributions configuration

DESCRIPTION
-----------

burps can be used to generate different packages for different
distributions.

DISTRIBUTION OPTIONS
--------------------

The distribution for which you want to build packages can be explicitely
defined, using the 'distributions' option, or detected automatically.

By default the distribution will be automatically detected, using the
'lsb_release' program. If the 'lsb_release' program is not available on
your distribution, or if for some reason you don't want to use the
autodetected distribution, you can define it manually in the
configuration.

Example :
----
lsb_release:
  id: Debian
  release: 7.0
  codename: wheezy
----

Alternatively you can use the 'distribution' option which can be set
on command line with the '--distribution' parameter. The 'distribution'
option can be used to set the distribution name (or 'lsb_release/id'),
and optionally the distribution release, using the following syntax :

- [id]
- [id]-[release]

Examples :
----
# building for Debian
$ burps build tor --distribution Debian
...
# building for Debian 7.0
$ burps build tor --distribution Debian-7.0
----

If you only specify the distribution name using the 'distribution'
option, then the 'release' and 'codename' will be undefined. If you
specify the distribution name and release, then if a matching
distribution exists in the configuration, the codename of that
distribution will be used, otherwise the codename will be undefined.

USING DISTRIBUTION OPTIONS IN TEMPLATES
---------------------------------------

When writting templates for your packages, the options that you should
use to act depending on distributions are 'lsb_release/id' for the
distribution name, 'lsb_release/release' for the distribution release
number, and optionally 'lsb_release/codename' for the codename.

Example :
----
[% IF c('lsb_release/id') == 'Debian'
        && versioncmp(c('lsb_release/release'), '7.0') < 0 %]
Depends: something
[% END %]
----

The 'distribution' option should not be used in templates, as it is
undefined when the distribution is detected automatically.

DISTRIBUTIONS DEFINITIONS
-------------------------

burps use different configuration files : project's config, workspace's
config, system's config, the default config. In each of those
configuration files, it is possible to define regular options, or
distribution specific options. The distribution specific options can be
defined for a family of distribution, of for a specific release or
codename.

The distribution specific options are defined in the 'distributions'
options, which is an array of distribution definitions. Each distribution
definition should at least contain a value for 'lsb_release/id', and
optionally 'lsb_release/release' or 'lsb_release/codename'.

In the following example we're saying that we want to compress tarballs
using :

- xz on Mageia distributions (any version)
- xz on Debian wheezy,
- bz2 on all other Debian versions,
- gz on all other distributions

----
compress_tar: gz
distributions:
 - lsb_release:
     id: Mageia
   compress_tar: xz
 - lsb_release:
     id: Debian
     codename: wheezy
   compress_tar: xz
 - lsb_release:
     id: Debian
   compress_tar: bz2
----

Except with multiple definitions of the same distribution and release
(which is not recommanded), the order of the definition is not
important. The value that will be used is the one from the distribution
definition that match the most the selected distribution : a distribution
that defines a matching id and codename will be used over one that only
defines an id.

DEFAULT DISTRIBUTIONS DEFINITIONS
---------------------------------

burps includes definitions for a few common distributions. You can see
them with 'burps showconf', looking at the 'default/distributions'
entries.
