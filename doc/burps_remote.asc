NAME

burps_remote - burps remote build

DESCRIPTION
-----------

It can be useful to run the build of your package on an external server,
a VM or a chroot. For instance if you are running an rpm based
distribution and want to build a Debian package.

To do do this, you can set any of the +remote+ options :

- +remote/deb+ for the build of Debian packages

- +remote/deb_src+ for the build of Debian source packages

The +remote+ option is an hash containing the following options :

exec::
        the template of a command used to execute a command on a remote
        host. The command to be executed is available in the option
        +exec_cmd+.

put::
        the template of a command used to upload a file or directory on
        the remote host. The source file path is available in option
        +put_src+ and destiration path in option +put_dst+.

get::
        the template of a command used to download a file or directory
        from the remote host. The source file path is available in
        option +get_src+ and destination path in option +get_dst+.

mktmpdir::
        the template of a command to create a temporary directory. If
        undefined, `mktemp -d` will be used.


REMOTE BUILD WITH SSH
---------------------

Some predefined +remote+ templates are available in the option
*remote_ssh*. For instance if you want to build your debian packages on
a remote node with ssh, add the following lines to your configuration :

----
ssh_host: some_hostname
remote:
  deb_src:
     exec: "[% c('remote_ssh/exec') %]"
     put: "[% c('remote_ssh/put') %]"
     get: "[% c('remote_ssh/get') %]"
----

The +remote_ssh+ options will use the following options :

ssh_host::
        The hostname where to connect. It can also contain a username.

ssh_port::
        Optionally you can set a port using this option. You could also
        do it by editing your +.ssh/config+ file.

ssh_options::
        Optionally you can set some ssh options, for the exec command.

scp_options::
        Optionally you can set some scp options, for the put or get
        commands.
