NAME
----
burps_remote - burps remote build

DESCRIPTION
-----------

It can be useful to run the build of your package on an external server,
a VM or a chroot. For instance if you are running an rpm based
distribution and want to build a Debian package.

To do do this, you can set any of the +remote+ options :

- +remote/deb+ for the build of Debian packages

- +remote/deb_src+ for the build of Debian source packages

The +remote+ option is an hash containing the following options :

exec::
        the template of a command used to execute a command on a remote
        host. The command to be executed is available in the option
        +exec_cmd+.

mktmpdir::
        the template of a command to create a temporary directory. If
        undefined, `mktemp -d` will be used.

The input files and build results are copied to and from the remote
server using tar and the +exec+ option.


REMOTE BUILD WITH SSH
---------------------

Some predefined +remote+ templates are available in the option
*remote_ssh*. For instance if you want to build your debian packages on
a remote node with ssh, add the following lines to your configuration :

----
ssh_host: some_hostname
remote:
  deb_src:
     exec: "[% c('remote_ssh/exec') %]"
----

The +remote_ssh+ options will use the following options :

ssh_host::
        The hostname where to connect. It can also contain a username.

ssh_port::
        Optionally you can set a port using this option. You could also
        do it by editing your +.ssh/config+ file.

ssh_options::
        Optionally you can set some ssh options, for the exec command.


BUILD IN A CHROOT
-----------------

You can use the +remote_chroot+ option if you want to build in a chroot.
This option requires that you have sudo access to the chroot command.

The following options are used by the +remote_chroot+ option:

chroot_path::
        The path to the chroot directory.

chroot_user::
        The user in the chroot which should run the build.

Example:

----
chroot_path: /chroots/debian-wheezy
chroot_user: build
remote:
  deb:
    exec: '[% c("remote_chroot/exec") %]'
