abbrev::
        This option returns the abbreviated commit hash of the +git_hash+
        commit.

abbrev_lenght::
        This option sets the lenght of the abbreviated commits, when
        using the +abbrev+ option.

tar::
        Use this options instead of 'tar' in build scripts when you want
        to create deterministic tar files. This options set tar arguments
        so that owner and group of files is set to root, and mtime is
        set to +timestamp+. Note that you cannot use tar old option style
        (without a dash) when using this, as they will not be the first tar
        argument.
