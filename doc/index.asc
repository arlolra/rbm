Download and installation
-------------------------

It is recommended to install +burps+ using packages. Unfortunately there
is no publicly available packages yet. The reason is that I want to
implement the feature to manage package repositories before I make some
packages available. But it should be done soon.

It's also possible to clone this git repository somewhere, and add a
script similar to this one in your $PATH to run burps :

----
#!/bin/sh
burps_dir=/some/directory
export PERL5LIB=$burps_dir/lib
exec $burps_dir/burps "$*"
----

You will also need perl and the following perl modules installed :

 - YAML::XS

 - Getopt::Long

 - Template

 - IO::CaptureOutput

 - File::Slurp

 - String::ShellQuote

Also see this note about link:git-version.html[git version].
