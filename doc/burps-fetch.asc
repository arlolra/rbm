NAME
----
burps-fetch - Fetch commits from remote git repository


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'burps fetch' [project]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Fetch commits from remote git repository for the select project.
If no project is selected, fetch commits for all projects.

This command is useful when the 'fetch' option has been set to 0. When
the 'fetch' option is set to 1, all new commits are automatically
fetched, so there is no need to use this command.

Alternatively, the '--fetch' option can be used on other commands.
