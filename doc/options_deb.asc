debian_revision::
        The package revision used in debian packages. By default, when
        the option +pkg_rel+ is defined, this is what is used. Otherwise
        a revision containing the number of commits since the last git
        tag, and the hash of the commit is used.

deb_src::
        This is the script that is used to create the debian source
        package. By default it will use the debian files listed in the
        option +debian_files+ and create the source package with
        dpkg-source.

deb::
        This is the script that is used to create the debian packages.
        By default it will use the debian files listed in the option
        +debian_files+ and build the package using debuild or pdebuild
        depending on whether the +use_pbuilder+ option is set. The
        packages will be signed using the key defined in the option
        +debsign_keyid+.

debian_files::
        This is an array containing the files to create in the debian
        directory. Each item in the array is an hash, with the following
        two keys : +name+ is the file name in the debian directory of
        the file to create, and +content+ is the content of the file.
        The filename and content are processed as template, so for
        instance if you want to store the content of a file in a separate
        file, you can use the INCLUDE directive.

use_pbuilder::
        If set to a true value, pbuilder will be used to build the
        debian packages.

debsign_keyid::
        This is the gpg key that will be used to sign the debian packages.
        Set to 0 if you don't want to sign the packages.
