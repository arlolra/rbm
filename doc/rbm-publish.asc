EXAMPLES
--------

In this example, we want to publish packages for Mageia and Debian. On
Mageia, the repository metadata are generated using 'genhdlist2'. On
Debian the new package is included in the repository using 'reprepro'.

The rbm configuration looks like this :
----
distributions:
 - lsb_release:
     id: Mageia
   repo_dir: /path/to/mageia/repo
   publish: |
    #!/bin/sh
    cp -va noarch/*.rpm [% c('repo_dir') %]
    genhdlist2 [% c('repo_dir') %]
 - lsb_release:
     id: Debian
   repo_dir: /path/to/debian/repo
   publish: |
     #!/bin/sh
     reprepro -b [% c('repo_dir') %] include \
                 [% c('lsb_release/codename') %] *.changes
----

If we want to upload the packages on a remote server, before including
them on the repository, this can be done like this :

----
distributions:
 - lsb_release:
     id: Debian
   repo_dir: /path/to/debian/repo
   publish: |
     #!/bin/sh
     reprepro -b [% c('repo_dir') %] include \
                 [% c('lsb_release/codename') %] *.changes
steps:
  publish:
    ssh_host: publish_server.somedomain
    remote_exec: "[% c('remote_ssh') %]"
----

An alternative could be to generate the repository locally, and add an
rsync command at the end of the 'publish' script to upload the repository
to your publication server :

----
distributions:
 - lsb_release:
     id: Debian
   local_repo: /path/to/debian/repo
   publish: |
     #!/bin/sh
     reprepro -b [% c('local_repo') %] include \
                 [% c('lsb_release/codename') %] *.changes
     rsync -avH --delete [% c('local_repo') %] publish_server.somedomain:/repo
