- The showconf command can now be used to display specific config for
  a project.
- All configuration options are now templates. The content of the rpm
  spec file, and the build scripts are now configuration options which
  by default use an include directive to include a template file.
- Add the exit_error function in templates
- Add the exec function in templates. This function takes a command as
  argument, run it inside the sources tree and return the output. The
  version option which was handled as a special case in the source code
  to execute the command defined in version_command if it is defined is
  now a normal option thanks to the exec function.
- Add the fetch option, to tell whether new commits from remote git
  repository should be fetched automatically.
