- Make it possible to use templating in output_dir option

- Use YAML::XS rather than YAML perl module


Version 0.2

- The showconf command can now be used to display specific config for
  a project.

- All configuration options are now templates. The content of the rpm
  spec file, and the build scripts are now configuration options which
  by default use an include directive to include a template file.

- Add the exit_error function in templates

- Add the exec function in templates. This function takes a command as
  argument, run it inside the sources tree and return the output. The
  version option which was handled as a special case in the source code
  to execute the command defined in version_command if it is defined is
  now a normal option thanks to the exec function.

- Add the fetch option, to tell whether new commits from remote git
  repository should be fetched automatically.

- Add the fetch command, to fetch new commits from a git repository

- rpm build is now done using a script, with template in the rpmbuild
  option, which can be customized if necessary.

- Use commit time as modification time on source tarball and rpm spec
  files. The timestamp option can be used to set this to an other value.

- Add the path function in templates

- Use a wrapper to run gpg from git. This allow us to use specific
  keyring files for some projects. While doing this we add the
  gpg_wrapper, gpg_keyring, gpg_keyring_dir, gpg_args, gpg_bin options.

- It's now possible to filter good gpg keys IDs with tag_gpg_id and
  commit_gpg_id with short or long IDs, or full fingerprint. Previously
  it was done using short IDs only.

- tag_gpg_id and commit_gpg_id can be set to 1 to accept signature from
  any key in the keyring.
